VulTek-Alert was born from the need to have a tool that notifies in a timely manner of the latest published vulnerabilities found in Red Hat systems.

To do this, VulTek-Alert makes use of the Red Hat Security Data API, where it performs a query to obtain said CVE's for later sending to a Telegram channel.

This with the purpose of being able to take timely actions to mitigate said vulnerabilities that could affect the infrastructure of an organization that occupies Red Hat systems.

# Applications
## VulTek-Alert
Application that obtains the CVE's published in the Red Hat Security Data API in a range of days, and sends alerts via Telegram about them.

![VulTek-Alert](https://github.com/erickrr-bd/VulTek-Alert/blob/master/screens/screen2.jpg)

Characteristics:
- Obtaining the CVE's is done at one hour of the day. This is configurable.
- Obtain CVE's in a range of days (starting from the current day). This is configurable.
- Obtains the CVE's of certain levels of criticality (low, moderate, important and critical). This is configurable.
- Send the CVE's found to a certain Telegram channel as an alert. This is configurable.
- If it does not find CVE's during the established range of days, it sends an alert to the Telegram channel mentioning that it did not find CVE's.
- It can be run as a service or daemon.
- When running as a service or daemon, it is run using the "vultek_alert" user. This for security purposes.
- Creation of application logs (in the path /var/log/VulTek-Alert).

## VulTek-Alert-Tool
Auxiliary graphical application for managing the configuration of the application as well as it's service or daemon.

Characteristics:
- Use of "dialog" for the use of graphical interfaces in the application.
- Manages the VulTek-Alert configuration (creation and modification).
- Manages the operations on the VulTek-Alert daemon or service (start, restart, stop and current status).
- Sensitive information is stored encrypted in YAML files.
- Creation of application logs (in the path /var/log/VulTek-Alert).

# Requirements
- CentOS 8 or RedHat 8 (So far it has only been tested in this version)
- Python 3.6
- Internet connection (specifically to the Telegram and Red Hat API).
- Python Libraries
  - requests
  - pycurl
  - pythondialog
  - pycryptodome
  - pyyaml

# Installation
To install or update VulTek-Alert you must run the script "installer_vultek_alert.sh" for this you can use any of the following commands:

`./installer_vultek_alert.sh` or `sh installer_vultek_alert.sh`

The installer performs the following actions on the computer:

- Copy and creation of directories and files necessary for the operation of VulTek-Alert.
- Creation of the user and group "vultek_alert", which is used only for the operation of the application.
- Assignment of owner to the user "vultek_alert" of the application components for their correct operation.
- Random creation of the passphrase for the encryption/decryption process of sensitive information. Therefore, this is unique to each VulTek-Alert implementation.
- Creation of the VulTek-Alert service or daemon.

# Running
## VulTek-Alert

- Run as service:

`systemctl start vultek-alert.service`

- To execute manually, first you must go to the path /etc/VulTek-Alert-Suite/VulTek-Alert and execute using the following commands:

`python3 VulTek_Alert.py` or `./VulTek_Alert.py`

## VulTek-Alert-Tool

- The first way to run VulTek-Alert-Tool, you must go to the path /etc/VulTek-Alert-Suite/VulTek-Alert-Tool and execute using the following commands:

`python3 VulTek_Alert_Tool.py` or `./VulTek_Alert_Tool.py`

- The second way to run VulTek-Alert-Tool is upon installation of VulTek-Alert an alias for VulTek-Alert-Tool is created. To use it, you must first execute the following command once the installation is complete:

`source ~/.bashrc`

Later, VulTek-Alert-Tool can be executed only by using the following command:

`VulTek-Alert-Tool`
